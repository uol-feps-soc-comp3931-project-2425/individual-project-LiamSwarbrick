RESULTS:
- Machine irrelevant since its only dependent on resolution but its the Lab Machine with NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070
- Counting number of area light ops at 1280x1080p in the Suntemple scene with ... area lights
- Each LTC_Evaluate call counts as a light op, I could have counted edge integration as the light op since it accounts for polygonal lights of different sizes, but culling only affects the number of LTC_Evaluate calls, not the edge integration so I only considered that.

Suntemple specular parameters (This scene is only slightly glossy so 10.0):
float param_roughness             = 1.0;
float param_min_intensity         = 0.01;
float param_intensity_saturation  = 10.0;

NORMAL COUNT | LOCATION A ops | fps   | LOCATION B ops | fps   | comment on artefacts
           1 |       89114000 |  25.0 |      102373650 |  25.0 | None since specular must be assigned to all clusters
           6 |        8486997 |  37.5 |       12935652 |  37.5 | None after tuning correct parameters for scene
          24 |        8492041 |  15.0 |       13003057 |  15.0 | None after tuning correct parameters for scene
          54 |        8496759 |   7.0 |       12985008 |   7.5 | None after tuning correct parameters for scene
           1 |        7152637 | 149.0 |       11945975 | 110.5 | Noticable specular incorrectness due to strange heuristic, could be tuned to be better but it's very fast right now so best for mostly-matte scenes.
