Should specular and diffuse clustering be different?

Also need to stress test on massive open plane..
So a small number of lights per pixel, but a vast world
so that the compute shader is stress tested more.

In writeup mention compute shader batch size testing maybe

Talk about implementation trying to utilize boolean vector operations in glsl
- like bvec lessThanEqual(vec x, vec y) and all() functions


Can do writeup in order of implementation if the section headings make that simple:
- glTF pbr renderer with point lights....
- point light clustered shading
- lambertian area lights implementation
- ltc-based area lights
- area lights with cluster shading.


// TODO: Maybe instead of using 3D AABB surface area as upper bound for polygon area,
    // find the polygons plane with the first 3 points (since n >= 3) then project onto 2D
    // and use the 2D AABB (could be a tighter upper bound but more costly cpu side which might be bad)
