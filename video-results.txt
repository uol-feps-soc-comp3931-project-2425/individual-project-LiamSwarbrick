Specular Clusters
Showing artefacts from missing terms that only affects near clusters!
====================================================================

Using 24 normal cones per cluster












Starting with Diffuse Bounds:















24-Normal Cone specular:
Firstly:  Light Cones without angular size terms 
 - The maths breaks down close to the lights


























Secondly: Including diffuse but no bound on range 
 - This solves the problem close to the lights


No artefacts but very performant because so many lights at a large distance

















Thirdly: Sadly we can't specular this far away and maintain performance.
         So we introduce 2*diffuse radius as a max. 

will compare performance to no specular 30 ms less shading time since less light is being added, 

This is fine so some scenes, and the radius can be changed.




Now we compare to much cheaper culling: specular with diffuse bounds
NO NORMAL CLUSTERS

much faster compute time of 2ms, but quite a bit more shading time.

We will compare light operations on this scene in this specific perspective:
NO NORMALS: 63552492
24 NORMALS: 42915180

Clearly considering normals significantly reduces expensive LTC light ops

If we make normal cone culling more efficient it would be the preffered method of adding specular










1280x720: 


TEST1: No normals with 1.5*specular range
TEST2: 24 Normal Cones with 1.5*specular range:



I ran the tests without OBS running and got these final results
on a NVIDIA GTX 1060 with 2016 area lights:
1: NO NORMALS LIGHT OPS = 70101700  ~1.6ms compute, ~124ms shading 
2: 24 NORMALS Light OPS = 42915180   ~30ms compute, ~67ms  shading

3: 6  NORMALS Light OPS = 42915180   ~8ms  compute, ~67ms  shading
4: 54 NORMALS Light OPS = 42915180   ~64ms compute, ~67ms  shading

CANDIDATE FOR BEST:
  6 NORMALS (16x9x24x6)













Strangely we get the exact same light ops with 6 normal cones!

















Now onto 24 normals, we get a massive reduction in light ops with same results:

Lets compare shading time:
24 normals: 69ms
no normals: 125ms
