The notes i've made here are off the top of my head and may 
accidentally be missing references i may have got them from.

In actual writeup the sources must be cited.

A well structured report will be easy to read and give off
the impression of being well done.


Pitch the report for other level 3 computer science students
thats the level that should be.
